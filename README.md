# Vitedge

[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) _Edge Side Rendering_ (ESR) framework for Vue and React, or bring your own view library.

> What's ESR? Think of SSR (Server Side Rendering) in CDN nodes instead of actual servers. This is possible today thanks to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) (and maybe some other platforms in the near future).

Vitedge is **just a Vite app ‚Ñ¢** that prerenders the first view in an edge worker and runs the rest as an SPA. That means it will lead to good SEO while keeping the snappy routing and DX of an SPA.

It can replace static site generators in some situations since it builds on the fly and caches at the edge. Therefore, instead of getting a static `index.html` from the CDN, the CDN itself will create it on the fly or provide it from cache if it was already accessed (with configurable cache age + stale-while-revalidate).

Even though running it at the edge is ideal, it is actually compatible with any Node environment such as Vercel or Netlify.

See [live demo](https://vitessedge.zable.workers.dev/), and [Vue](https://github.com/frandiox/vitessedge-template) or [React](https://github.com/frandiox/reactesse-edge-template) starter templates. If you want to bring your own view library, have a look at the [Vanilla JS example](./examples/vanilla) as a guide.

## Features

- ‚ö° Ultrafast development and HMR powered by Vite and ES Modules.
- ‚öîÔ∏è Renders and caches at the edge for maximum performance in production. Cache is configurable.
- üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Each page gets its server data as props by default but can be set in a store instead.
- üîΩ HTTP/2 server push for your assets to speed up the loading time without waterfall requests.
- üß± Automatically creates endpoints for your API based on filesystem routes.
